This is a tool for processing fastq sequencing data from DNA encoded library screens. 

The processed data will be output as csv files with absolute and normalized sequence counts.

Multiple screening conditions can be processed in one fastq sequence by using pcr to encode screening details.

All the contents of this root directory are required for proper functionality and should be kept together
as they are currently.

Detailed documetation pertaining to the setup and use of the tool can be found in the docs folder.
